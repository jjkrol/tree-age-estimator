Tree Age Estimator
==================

This is a simple website with a calculator estimating tree age based on diameter at breast
height, species and height (optional).

It was rewritten from jQuery to angular.js and probably is far from perfect. Feel free to see the
[example page](http://jjkrol.github.io/tree-age-estimator), or just fork it!
